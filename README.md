# IB Points Calculator
Side project during December Hols 2019 cause I no life 

You know when a task takes you more than 5 secs, so you spend 2 days automating it... this is exactly that :) 
This app helps you save a few seconds of your time by not having to look at the IB grade boundaries every time you want to check your grade for each subject. However, since I am selfish and want to use this app for myself. Also, the grade boundaries may not be official since it follows my school's internal boundaries (however they are based off IB's anyway. Maybe plus minus a few marks). Similarly, only the subjects offered by my school are available cause there is no API for IB grade boundaries and there is no way I am manuaually keying in all that data. 

Have a nice day :)
 
 ## Update (03-August-2020)
 
 App is broken since I took down the firebase containing all the grade boundaries. Syllabus has changed and I'm not updating since no one uses this anyway.
 Should you wish to rebuild a working version, make your own firebase DB and populate it with the grade boundaries then replace the google-services.json file.
